# 2048 Game

This is a simple implementation of the popular 2048 game using Angular framework.

## Getting Started

To play the game, simply follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd Game2048
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the development server:

ng serve
```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200` to play the game.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the tiles in the corresponding direction.
- Tiles with the same number will merge into one when they touch.
- The objective is to reach the 2048 tile by merging tiles strategically. Once you create a tile with the number 2048, you win the game.
- The game ends when there are no more moves possible.
